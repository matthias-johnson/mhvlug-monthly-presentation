# mhvlug-monthly-presentation

This is the monthly pre-meeting presentation designed for mhvlug.org
meetings. We run this prior to the meeting kicking off so that people
know they are in the right room, and to give them information about
upcoming events.

It is based on reveal.js, and the git tree is a fork from a point of time
of reveal.js. We'll rebase over time to bring in new features.
